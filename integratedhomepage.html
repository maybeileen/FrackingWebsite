            <h3></h3>
            <p>Fracking is a process of drilling into the Earth and injecting liquid, such as water, at high pressure to force open existing fissures and extract oil or gas.</p>
            <p>Natural Gas accounts for 25% of all the energy used in the U.S. By 2035, it is estimated that 46% of all natural gas will come from fracking.</p>
            <p>The average fracking well requires 50,000 gallons of water to operate over its lifetime.</p>
            <p>Water (90%) is combined with sand (9.5%) and a cocktail of chemicals (0.5%) to help in the fracking process and then injected into the well. Many of these chemicals range from food and common household cleaners to known carcinogens.</p>
            <p>20%-40% of this fluid flows back to the surface, polluted with dissolved solids and toxic chemicals.</p>
            <p>If drilled too shallow, or not inspected properly, wells can leak natural gas into the air and water. The process also causes small earthquakes (1-4 on the Riechter scale).</p>

    <h1>The Problem</h1>
    <section class="parallax2">
        <div class="parallax-inner2">
            <h3></h3>
            <p> Even though fracking has the potential to provide more oil and gas resources to consumers, the process of extraction has long-lasting negative impacts on the surrounding environment:</p>
            <h2>Environmental</h2>
                <p>Slickwater, which is water and chemicals from fracking mixed together, seeps into the ground and contaminates groundwater and the soil. <u>Ecosystems and habitats are being destroyed</u> through pollution that fracking emits. Fracking releases tons of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that <u>traps more than 4x the heat that carbon dioxide does</u>. </p>
            <h2>Social</h2>
                <p>Fracking requires the use of large volumes of water each time a well is fracked. This will lead to <u>water shortages</u>, especially in areas where water is already scarce. The chemicals that fracking uses also has a high potential to eventually reach our bodies (either through our water, food or air), thus <u>increasing our health costs</u>.</p>
